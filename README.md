# Paralog analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a series of R scripts that were used for the comparison of gene essentiality scores from uveal melanoma cell lines (`data/MAGeCK_gene_corrected_beta.tsv`; generated using MAGECK-MLE) and pan-cancer samples from DepMap in *Targeting the CDS1/2 axis as a therapeutic strategy in uveal melanoma and pan-cancer*
 

## Analysis Steps
Users can reproduce the scripts bundled in this package by creating a [Github codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) using the `.devcontainer.json` file that is bundled with these scripts.

## Dependencies
This analysis was conducted with R (4.2.3). All R dependencies for this project are detailed within the project `renv.lock` file.
